# GraphQL tutorial

This repo is code that was written - and in some cases copied from the sample project - based on this [graphql tutorial](https://medium.com/naresh-bhatia/graphql-concepts-i-wish-someone-explained-to-me-a-year-ago-514d5b3c0eab)

Notes:
* some of the source code has been written by me, even though it may be an almost exact copy of the sample project.
    * the goal of this was to try to write it from memory and see what type of problems I run into
    * this was the case for most of the server-side code
* other parts were copied directly from the sample project (available at [https://github.com/nareshbhatia/graphql-bookstore.git](https://github.com/nareshbhatia/graphql-bookstore.git))
    * this was the case for most of the front-end, as I did not intend to focus on this part
* there seems to be some problems with the latest version of some libraries, particularly `merge-graphql-schemas`
    * because of this, the package.json, package-lock.json and yarn.lock were copied over
